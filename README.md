# MussHaben

**The advanced willhaben search agent.**

This project is a PWA web application that allows users to create search agents for specific product categories on the Willhaben website.
Unlike the existing built-in search agent, this application notifies users of new products only in a matter of minutes instead of hours.

## Problem

The existing built-in search agent on the Willhaben website is not efficient in notifying users of new products. It can take hours for users to receive notifications about new products that match their search criteria, which can lead to missed opportunities and frustration.

## Development

### Start-Up

To start the development environment, we need to start:
- the firebase emulator's: `firebase emulators:start --import=./emulator-data --export-on-exit=./emulator-data`
- the react vite frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

### Deployment

#### Frontend

The frontend is deployed on firebase hosting automatically on every push to the main branch. Alternatively, you can deploy the frontend to firebase hosting by running `firebase deploy --only hosting` from the root of the project.

#### Backend

To deploy the application to firebase run `firebase deploy --only firestore,functions,auth` from the root of the project.
